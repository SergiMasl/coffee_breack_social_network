There is a federal warrant out for his arrest on charges of credit card fraud, and he is wanted as a \"person of interest\" in the investigation into the killing of 22-year-old Petito.  Tik Tok account @charlienovasite posted a zoomed-in version of the video captioned, “There is definitely someone there. You cannot change my mind.”  At least three other accounts also posted the footage, prompting thousands of responses and people asking the police to search the backyard.  The @charlienovasite account also posted videos taken by Petito of Brian Laundrie in a van together.  “Look how content he is in small spaces, not needing much room,” the account wrote. “Look at the tools and basic building knowledge the Laundries have. Don’t tell me a hideout under that new garden is impossible.”  Bunker contractors told Fox News it would be possible to construct a subterranean hideout in their yard and that false flower beds could be used to conceal the entrance.","author":"Fox News","time":1634134803390,"id":1634134803400},{"title":"hey","text":"test 2","author":"","time":1634139977382,"id":1634139977392},{"title":"hello","text":"new new","author":"","time":1634142954031,"id":1634142954040}]
